= Introduction =

The ExtC Visualizer helps the programmer understand a Java class's structure by visually emphasizing important
features of the class's members and their inter-relationships.
It also helps users see how various clustering
algorithms group the class's members. These insights help
a programmer choose appropriate techniques for refactoring
large classes.

This [http://code.google.com/p/ext-c/wiki/ExtractClassPlugInInstallation page] has installation instructions for the Eclipse plugins.
